# Exoplanet Modeling for NASA's TESS Mission (TFOP Sub-Group 1)

Two year's worth of code contributions to our work in conducting and reducing follow-up observations of transiting exoplanets identified by NASA's TESS Satellite. Further directories also include work on orbital decay models and some basic photometric maintenance.

## What is TESS?

TESS is a satellite that was launched by NASA in 2018 to perform an all-sky survey of transiting exoplanets. Transits are planets which pass in front of their star, creating a reduction in the light observed from that star during their transit. From this light reduction, one can model the transit's orbital behavior, and obtain critical information about orbital dynamics and planet characteristics. Our work focused on taking observations of these target exoplanets using our automated observatory and reducing the photometric data into useful light curves to be processed for further research.

## Exoplanet Modeling Tools and Light Curve Examples

The former of these folders contains the main scripts used to generate light curves from our transit observations. Our light curve models utilized Monte Carlo Markov Chains to create the best fit our collected data. The Light Curve Exaples Script shows a few example light curves and their respective corner plots that were made in this proccess

## Orbital Decay

This directory contains a number of scripts focused on launching a new research project focused on orbital decay. Most of these were just playing around with the physics of orbital dynamics and creating a foundation to pass onto future students who would continue research in this field.
